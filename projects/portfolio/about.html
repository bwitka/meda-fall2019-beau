                <p>Hello, my name is Beau! I have always been someone who has possessed a love to learn new skills and utilize my innate capacity for design and problem solving. This is what has brought me to where I am today, studying to be a full stack web developer and designer. Throughout my adulthood I have taught myself various skills from landscaping to auto body work to interior storage and organization. In college, I studied Spanish Language and Literature.</p>
                
                <p>On my accompanying projects page, you will see firsthand the wide variety of projects I have undertaken over the years. An attention to detail and uncompromising work ethic have been a common thread throughout my work history and I look forward to someday employ the same qualities as a web developer and designer. I enjoy being challenged and learning new skills. This is part of what attracted me to the field of web design. My learning journey began just over four years ago and, even with the pitfalls and hurdles I have had to maneuver, it has never ceased to be a rewarding experience for me.</p>
