          Why I Ride a Bicycle
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many reasons why I ride a bicycle but I think that first and foremost it's the sense of freedom I feel when I am on a bicycle that I like so much. I am not dependent on anything but myself and my bike. When I take public transportation, not only do I need to factor in traffic conditions but I need to allow extra time for the bus to be late. Driving a car, especially here in San Francisco, can be a nightmare when considering traffic, parking, and the cost of owning and maintaining a car.
          </p>
          <p>
          Cycling, on the other hand, is free. Furthermore, it's often the fastest way to get around town. When I cycle I feel good. If I am in a bad mood or feeling blue, I immediately feel better once I am on my bicycle. I am out in the open, getting exercise, and moving myself from one place to another.
          </p>
          <p>
          Last but not least is the environmental factor: cycling is probably one of the most eco-friendly ways to get around. Of course one could argue that there's an impact on the environment when a bicycle is manufactured or that different bicycle parts, such as the tires, are made from petroleum-based products, but overall those drawbacks are far outweighed by the light carbon footprint left behind when someone cycles versus when they drive a car or take public transit. At a time when our climate is getting more and more chaotic with every passing year, the planet could benefit immensely if more of us embraced cycling as our main mode or transport.

        <h1>How It Began</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          Bicycles Have Always Been a Part of My Life
        </p>
        <p>
          Considering that both of my parents were bicycle messengers here in San Francisco in the late 1970s when I was conceived, and that my mom continued to use a bicycle to get around the city while she was pregnant, bicycles really have been a part of my life for a long time. The first bicycle I remember riding was a small red Schwinn Typhoon that my parents picked up at a thrift store in the Mission. I outgrew that bicycle by the time I was nine or ten years old and Santa Claus brought my brother and I matching blue Cannondale mountain bikes for Christmas. I rode the Cannondale for several years, till I outgrew it as well, and it was at that point that I started to ride my mom's old Ritchey mountain bike. This is the same bike I continue to ride today.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't get really serious about cycling as my main mode of transport until I moved back to San Francisco from New York City for seven months in 2013. At that time, I was taking classes at City College of San Francisco several days a week and needed to figure out a way to get to and from school. After getting accustomed to New York's subway system and not driving a car at all for more than five years, there was no way I was going to commute on San Francisco's public transit or drive my family's car. So I took my mom's old Ritchey in to a local bike shop and had them turn it into a commuter bicycle. 
        </p>
        <p>
          When I returned to New York from 2014 - 2015 I didn't cycle much except for the occasional recreational ride. However, when I came back to San Francisco in mid-2015, I picked up where I left off in 2013 and have been on a bicycle ever since. In 2017 the city experienced a heavy rainy season and I almost gave up on cycling as a way to get around due to my dislike of riding in the rain. Nonetheless, I loath MUNI so much that I instead invested in rain gear and continue to ride everywhere - rain or shine.

        <h1>A Versatile Mode of Transport</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          Commuting, Grocery Shopping, Exercise, and Much More
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the reasons I enjoy cycling so much is that every time I ride my bicycle I am fulfilling multiple goals. Although I am someone who doesn't cycle recreationally, that doesn't limit all that I can accomplish with my bicycle. I commute to MEDA for Mission Techies every weekday morning, riding approximately 6 miles each direction, from one end of San Francisco to the other. Therefore, just on my daily commute alone, I am getting exercise as well as transporting myself to and from class.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oftentimes, I will make one or more stops on my ride home, going to a doctor's appointment, grocery shopping, or any other host of errands. I have outfitted my bike in such a way that it's able to carry me and various cargo, but I am by no means the only cyclist who is utilizing their bike in this way. Every morning I ride alongside parents who are using different types of bicycles to bring their children to school. Additionally, I frequently see cyclists carrying their surfboards to and from the beach. The versatility of  bicycles is underestimated by most of the public, especially those who don't yet cycle. The truth is, the uses for a bicycle go far beyond simply transporting one person from point A to point B.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last but not least is the environmental component of cycling. I believe that cyclists deserve serious praise for their role in protecting the planet and slowing down the pace of its destruction. Whether or not it's a reason why someone cycles, everyone who rides a bicycle is doing everybody else a service. Not only does a bicycle not pollute the air, it also reduces traffic congestion and creates more available parking spaces for those who choose to drive cars.

        <p class="lead">
          How to Get Started
        </p>
        <p>
          Why should you ride a bicycle in the city when there are so many other ways to get around? In answering this question, I'll just give my top three reasons. It's free, it's often faster or nearly as fast as a bus (and sometimes even a car!), and you'll be getting exercise. If you compare bicycles and cars, there are even more reasons to ride a bike. Parking and traffic have become huge headaches for folks who drive cars in San Francisco. Yet when you ride a bicycle, parking and traffic are almost never an issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting to use a bicycle as your main mode of transport can be hard, and I speak from experience. It took me years of being an occasional cyclist to finally get serious enough to get on my bike for 99% of the trips I make around town. As with many things in life, I really think it boils down to forming a habit. With me, at one point there was a voice in my head saying things like "it's too far" or "it's easier to drive" or "I'm too tired," so I'd decide to not ride my bike and would get in a car or take the bus instead. However, as time progressed, I was able to push past those moments of deliberation and quickly came to see that the benefits of riding a bike far outweigh the drawbacks. Now all I need to do is take the bus or drive and I immediately wish I was on a bicycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before you can start to ride a bicycle, you need to get a bicycle. In the interest of brevity, I'll only mention one good place to find a bicycle and that's <a href="https://sfbay.craigslist.org" target="_blank">craigslist</a>. As someone who has sold multiple bicycles on craigslist, I can tell you that the buyer has the advantage - and in this case you'll be the buyer. I was never able to sell my bikes for what they were actually worth, so rest assured that you will be able to find a decent used bicycle without spending too much money.
        </p>
        <p>
          After buying a bicycle, you'll want to safeguard your investment and also buy a good lock (or two)to protect it against theft. It may be worthwhile to shop for a used lock on craigslist as well since good bicycle locks are not cheap. Nonetheless, this is not an area where you'll want to cut costs. I have been fortunate enough to have never had a bicycle stolen after over twenty years of urban cycling in San Francisco and New York, but I have always used expensive locks and usually more - not less - locks than necessary. Never underestimate bicycle thieves and secure or remove as much as you can when locking up your bike.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further down the road, quite literally, after buying a bicycle, a good lock or two, and getting used to riding around town, you may just decide you want to learn how to repair and maintain your own bicycle. Since tools, bike stands, and so forth can be expensive, I highly recommend making use of a public work space such as the <a href="http://bikekitchen.org/" target="_blank">Bike Kitchen</a>. I have personally not been yet, but hear very good things about this organization. Other affordable options for learning how to fix your own bike are <a href="https://www.rei.com/stores/san-francisco.html" target="_blank">REI</a> and the <a href="https://sfbike.org" target="_blank">San Francisco Bicycle Coalition</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fear is a legitimate basis why many people refuse to cycle in the city and they have good reason to be afraid. I recently read that San Francisco is one of the most dangerous cities in the nation for cyclists and pedestrians. And, as someone who cycles the city streets nearly every day, I believe it. On the same note, there are more and more ways to stay safe and that's what I'll be covering in the next section.

        <h1>Staying Safe</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          The Dangers of Riding a Bicycle
        </p>
        <p>
          While it's true that riding a bicycle, especially in a city, can be dangerous, there are ways to protect yourself and reduce the risk of accidents and injury. This section won't cover all of the ways you can stay safe while cycling in the city but I have included a few resources at the bottom of the page with more information on the subject. If I could only mention my top five ways to cycle safely they would include being as visible as possible, never assuming you know what a motorist will do, obeying the rules of the road, riding assertively, and always remaining alert - keeping both your eyes and ears open to what's happening around you.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be visible to motorists and others on the road around you, there are a few things you can do. I wear as much high visibility clothing and gear as possible, including a bright orange construction vest over my normal clothing. Lights will also make you much more visible, and not only at night. There are bike lights that are specifically designed for daytime use. As with bicycle locks, please don't be cheap when it comes time to buy lights. I highly recommend paying a little more for USB rechargeable lights versus those that require batteries. Lastly, I am a huge advocate for using a horn or whistle when cycling as a means of alerting motorists of your presence. The best bike horn on the market that I know of is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hornit-dB140-Bike-Headlight-Cyclists/dp/B07G9Q7BFK" target="_blank">Hornit</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I mentioned earlier, never assume what a car will do; they can be extremely unpredictable at times. For instance, if a motorist is signaling to turn left and you're planning to pass them on the right, there's a good chance they may change their mind and turn right without much warning. Unpredictable drivers are more and more common in the age of ride sharing apps such as Lyft and Uber, where drivers commute into the city from suburban areas where there aren't many cyclists on the road. The best advice is to "be ready for anything." Ride defensively and assert your space on the road. As cyclists, we often have the right (by law) to take up an entire lane. It is particularly important to keep a safe distance from parked and double-parked cars, who may open their doors into your path with very little warning. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, use common sense. Obey the rules of the road and remain alert at all times. Many folks like to bike with earbuds in their ears, but I personally like to be able to hear what's going on around me at all times. In some municipalities it's actually illegal to use earbuds while cycling. As for obeying traffic laws, I must admit that I am someone who oftentimes does not stop at a stop sign if there are no other vehicles at the intersection when I arrive. However, I see many cyclists brazenly run through stop signs and red lights in front of oncoming traffic and I think this is a very foolish thing to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being afraid of cars is actually a good thing because not being afraid might just cost you your life. As my instructor Eduardo likes to say, the bicyclist will always lose when there's an accident between a bicycle and a car. Therefore it's better to err on the side of caution and not play dangerous games with cars. Don't let the fear of cycling in the city stop you from ever giving it a try, but never stop exercising your best judgement. If more people start to cycle, I believe it will become safer for everyone. So don't wait any longer and give cycling a try!
