      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        Hello, my name is Beau! I have always been someone who has possessed a
        love to learn new skills and utilize my innate capacity for design and
        problem solving. This is what has brought me to where I am today,
        studying to be a full stack web developer and designer. Throughout my
        adulthood I have taught myself various skills from landscaping to auto
        body work to interior storage and organization. In college, I studied
        Spanish Language and Literature.
      </p>

      <p>
        On my accompanying projects page, you will see firsthand the wide
        variety of projects I have undertaken over the years. An attention to
        detail and uncompromising work ethic have been a common thread
        throughout my work history and I look forward to someday employ the same
        qualities as a web developer and designer. I enjoy being challenged and
        learning new skills. This is part of what attracted me to the field of
        web design. My learning journey began just over four years ago and, even
        with the pitfalls and hurdles I have had to maneuver, it has never
        ceased to be a rewarding experience for me.
