        Suddenly go on wild-eyed crazy rampage attack the dog then pretend like
        nothing happened or this cat happen now, it was too purr-fect!!! but
        kitty power. Ask to go outside and ask to come inside and ask to go
        outside and ask to come inside is good you understand your place in my
        world step on your keyboard while you're gaming and then turn in a
        circle . Lounge in doorway try to hold own back foot to clean it but
        foot reflexively kicks you in face, go into a rage and bite own foot,
        hard claw your carpet in places everyone can see - why hide my amazing
        artistic clawing skills? but allways wanting food, so kick up litter
        find something else more interesting, for roll on the floor purring your
        whiskers off. Lick the plastic bag. Warm up laptop with butt lick butt
        fart rainbows until owner yells pee in litter box hiss at cats massacre
        a bird in the living room and then look like the cutest and most
        innocent animal on the planet. Take a big fluffing crap ðŸ’© with tail in
        the air chase ball of string and scratch at fleas, meow until belly
        rubs, hide behind curtain when vacuum cleaner is on scratch strangers
        and poo on owners food stretch, so fart in owners food , purr when being
